# Rails Cookbook

For my javascript project I decided to take the same concept as my rails project, the Cookbook app. Learning javascript was a bit difficult for me therefore i was only able to impliment two of the crud functionalities, read and create. After graduation I intend to create the CookBook app using ruby and javascript with full CRUD functionality. 

## Instalation
follow instruction for the backend project found at https://github.com/JohannesHupfeld/jsCookBook_backend

once this is up and running run rails s to get the server up

in the the front end side run open index.html to open up the app
